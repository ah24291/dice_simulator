# Dice Simulator

## Description
A Python project that simulates rolling two dice multiple times.  
It calculates the frequency, probability, and expected value of each dice sum.  
Additionally, it generates a histogram of results and **saves it automatically** in the `results/` folder.  

This project demonstrates probability, loops, and basic statistics in Python.

## Features
- Customizable number of dice rolls
- Customizable number of sides per die
- Displays probabilities and expected value
- Plots a histogram of results and saves it as `results/dice_histogram.png`
- Fully reproducible and easy to run in VS Code or any Python environment

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ah24291/dice_simulator.git
